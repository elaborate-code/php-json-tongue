# CONTRIBUTING

All PRs are welcomed :)

## Coding Style

PHP JSON tongue follows the `PSR-2` coding standard and the `PSR-4` autoloading standard.

## PHPDoc

PHPDoc blocs aren't required, but type hinting is required when possible.

## Pint

```
./vendor/bin/pint
```

Don't worry if your code styling isn't perfect! `Fix PHP code style issues` action will automatically merge any style fixes into the PHP JSON tongue repository after pull requests are merged. This allows us to focus on the content of the contribution and not the code style.

## Testing

The added code needs to be well tested and not reduce the coverage. Feel free to use `Pest` or `PHPUnit`.
